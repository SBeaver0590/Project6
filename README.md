# Project6
 
###Description

In this project I've created a gorgeous portfolio site where I'll showcase the amazing projects I've built.
You'll see a little bit about me as well a glimpse of my 5 projects thus far.

I'll have a JSON file. Pug will be used to complete provided templates that utilize JSON to generate mark up
displayed in the browser. I'll use node.js as well as Express to import required dependencies, link the JSON 
with the pug templates, set up routes to handle requests, set up the middleware to utilize static files, 
handle errors, and set up a server to handle the project.
